At startup opens a window with a choice of figure (square, triangle, pentagon). 
In the selected container (figure), which rotates, a simple physics engine is modeled for a circle (considered as a ball with a fixed radius).
At each frame, the position of the circle is updated to account for gravity 
(which remains constant in world coordinates) and collisions with the boundaries of the rotating container are handled.
